# hello-world

My first repository! Dipping my toes into the world of github...

I'm a dinosaur from the world of 1995, about when I first had an opportunity to buy my first computer, an IBM model something-or other...I can't recall right now. Five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy drive, monochrome screen, bbs-capable with a dial-up modem. Now, I'm using a MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), brushing up my HTML/CSS skills by creating a simple website for personal use. I wanted to install Soundflower, the link brought me to GitHub, and I got curious!
